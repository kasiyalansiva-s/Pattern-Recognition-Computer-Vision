Image Matching Baseline
Overview
Implemented an image matching pipeline to match images from a directory to a specified target image.

Matching is done by:

Extracting a 7x7 pixel window from the center of images as a feature vector
Comparing feature vectors using sum-of-squared distance metric
Finding images with most similar vectors to target image
