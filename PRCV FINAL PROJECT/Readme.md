## Project Title: Segmentation and Auto-labeling of Insect's Legs Using Machine Learning for DeepLabCut
### Description:
This project focuses on automating the labor-intensive process of labeling insect legs for DeepLabCut, a widely used tool for animal behavior analysis. The researchers propose an automated approach that combines advanced image processing techniques, feature detection algorithms like Shi-Tomasi Corner Detection, template matching, and clustering methods to achieve accurate leg labeling. By leveraging these techniques, the project aims to streamline the annotation process, reducing manual effort while maintaining high precision. The study evaluates the automated method against manual labeling using a confusion matrix, demonstrating its effectiveness in segmenting and auto-labeling insect legs with high accuracy. The results suggest that this approach not only supports the specific needs of DeepLabCut but also offers a scalable solution for labeling complex biological structures, paving the way for more efficient and accurate analysis of insect behaviors.
