#### I have used the Windows 11 operating system and Visual Studio to run and compile the code.

* I have incorporated keys like Key "m", Key "s" and Key "q". 
* If Key "s" is pressed it will go to save mode and saves all the corner points and 3D world points and store the corresponding images in it too.
* If Key "m" is pressed is pressed it will apply an overlay image to make the chessboard pattern look like not a pattern (extension).
* If Key "q" is pressed it will exit the program.
* I have made one code for 1 - 3 tasks, the second cpp file has tasks 4-6, the Third cpp file has tasks 7, and the extension is one separate file.

#### I have used a one-time travel day to submit the project by 03/19/2024 at 11:59 pm.
